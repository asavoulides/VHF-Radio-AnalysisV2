They didn't indicate that was stolen or was used without authority. And they did tell that it was coming back, so I'm wondering if somebody, an employee, let him borrow it for whatever he was doing. But can you just confirm, Alin, that they didn't get a report that this this guy was stolen from the dealership? I just got off the line with Lyn right now. They were a little confused with the VOLO as well. Let let me give him a quick call back. I'll confirm that. JP, can you take the VIN for the vehicle? Go ahead.",
